hi, if youre reading this, these are the only logical issues left in the code(mostly vendor side), and unfortunately i have ran out of time (2am)
if you are free/want to try,or still accepting amendments, below are the listed logical errors that i did not solve in time.
else, it is what it is.

vendor_shopmanagement.php
1. the fuction dropdown option for toggling available and unavailable for a food item does not work.
2. restaurant management option shows everyone's shop item, and every vendor can see it
3. if you're not the food item owner, clicking the delete button on an item will result in an sql error.
4. if you're not the food item owner, trying to add an item will result in vendor error, same goes for editing the item
5. If you have ocd, the items in restaurant management are not aligned

That is all.
